				<h3>Cyberbullying and How It Affects Others (Argumentative)</h3>
				<p>Cyberbullying tends to be forgotten in curriculums. Most teach not to bully but don’t necessarily teach not to cyberbullying. Most reasons could be because people don’t think it’s as serious as it is, or maybe people don’t think that it affects as many people as it does. CART should introduce a curriculum that teaches what cyberbullying and how it affects others.</p>
				<p>Cyberbullying is a broad term, whether you’re talking about its legal definition, or its casual definition. The most widely accepted definition, as said by the article “What is Cyberbullying” on the website StopBullying, is “Cyberbullying is bullying that takes place over digital devices like cell phones, computers, and tablets.”</p>
				<p>This can be separated into many categories based on what kind of cyberbullying is happening. One example is roasting. Roasting is when a person or a group of people tell offensive jokes about another person. Although this could be done while not online, it is mostly done online. Another type of cyberbullying is trolling. Trolling is when somebody posts mean comments or fights online with somebody purposefully to anger the reader. An example of this would be going to a forum that talks about political views and going to that forum for the intent to post comments that would specifically not align with their political views and fight with them purely with the intent of angering or enraging them. Much like roasting, this could be done offline too. Spamming is another type of cyberbullying. Spamming is doing something such as posting, messaging, or commenting excessively with an aim in annoying the recipient. Outing is an especially damaging type of cyberbullying. It is the release of information without permission of the person of which the information belongs to. An example of this is somebody posting unflattering images which you may have sent to somebody in confidence. Finally there are mashups, which is content which makes fun of the original content.

				<h3>Edward Snowden. Was He Right? (Argumentative)</h3>
				<p>When I was a little boy, my sister told me that she was having trouble with Algebra II. So, being the little kid that I was, I told my parents. She got the help that she needed, and passed, but she was very mad at me. Same goes with Snowden. Even though America didn’t want him to leak the documents, it was exactly what America needed. He was a hero.</p>
				<p>Snowden showed us exactly what we needed to see, and he is a hero because of it.
			He is not the only one that thinks that what the government is doing wrong. Russ Tice, a security analyst says that, “I have seen some things (In the intelligence community) that are illegal” (Ian McFarlane). This means that other people actually believe that the government is doing wrong. Some people even say that the country is better after what he has released. Anthony Romero says that he thinks “our country is better as a result of the revelations of Mr. Snowden” (Dan Mercia & Elise Labott). This shows that people think that Edward Snowden made our country better. All in all, people think that Edward Snowden is correct and that he did a service to our country to show what the government has been doing.</p>
