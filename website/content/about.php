		<p class="centertext">Hello, I am Nathaniel Barragan, and I’m a nerd.</p>

		<p>I am an aspiring programmer and have been programming as my hobby for about 7 years. Although my interests in programming change often, my love of programming in general has always stayed true. I always find some way to do it. On a computer, on my phone, on my 3DS, even on paper, I always find a way.</p>
		<p>I was born and raised in Fresno, CA. My dream place to live would be San Diego, CA. The programming opportunities there are strong, and I like being close to the beach. The cool weather definitely helps with my decision, but for now, I’m finishing up my senior year in high school.</p>
		<p>In my free time I like to program, write music, and play video games. My personal favorite video game is Metroid (Specifically Zero Mission). It’s been my favorite for quite a while. I also like games such as Final Fantasy Tactics Advance, World of Warcraft, and Bejeweled. My favorite genre of music is orchestral, but I’m okay with pretty much any genre.</p>
		<p>My main hobby, which I want to make a job, is programming. It’s something I’ve always had a strong passion for and would love to do it for the rest of my life. I’ve done many small projects and helped with many, but have yet to complete many large projects on my own. I enjoy many different topics of programming such as web, game development, and operating system development. I plan on expanding my knowledge in all of these topics as much as I can. There’s always something new to learn!</p>
