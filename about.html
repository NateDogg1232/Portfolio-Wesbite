                <p class="centertext">Hello, I am Nathaniel Barragan, and I’m a nerd.</p>

                <p>I am an aspiring programmer living in Fresno. I’ve been doing such for 6 years. Some main things that I do with my free time is program, write music, and play video games. Programming is what I do with most of my time. Even when I’m not on my computer, I’m programming on my phone, my 3DS, and even on paper.</p>
                <p>I was born and raised in Fresno, but my dream place to live is San Diego. Don’t get me wrong, I love Fresno, and living there would be perfectly okay with me, but the nice weather, the amazing food, and being so close to the beach would be very nice to have. Just me, my beautiful girlfriend and my cats. Nothing better.</p>
                <p>My main hobby which I want to make a job is programming. It is something I have a strong passion for and plan to do for the rest of my life. I’ve done many small projects and have helped many with projects, but have yet to complete a large project on my own. I am currently working on an operating system called Cosine OS or COS for short. This has to be the largest project and most difficult project I’ve ever taken on, but it is quite fun and rewarding to do, and for that reason, I plan on following through with it.</p>
